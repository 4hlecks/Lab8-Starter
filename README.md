## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation and service workers are related such that hey both aim to make sure that web application functions across different conditions. Graceful degradation assures functionality in older browsers even if it is not as great in modern browsers, while service workers help the web application function by caching resources and provide functionality while for example the network goes offline.
